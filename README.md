# My Personal Project

## Sudoku game
This project is aimed at creating an interactive Sudoku game where users can generate new puzzles, solve them, and check their solutions. The application will offer different difficulty levels, allowing users to choose their preferred challenge. Once the puzzle is completed, the app will provide a feature to verify if the solution is correct, and it will also track the time taken to solve the puzzle, adding an additional layer of engagement.

This project is designed for individuals who enjoy brain games and puzzle-solving. It is especially appealing to those who are looking for a customizable Sudoku experience with features like difficulty settings and performance tracking. I am particularly interested in this project because it involves manipulating 2D arrays, which presents a unique challenge. Working with complex data structures in this way is both intriguing and enjoyable for me, providing an opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills.
